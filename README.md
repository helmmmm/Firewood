easily combustible small sticks or twigs used for starting a fire. ðŸ”¥

Kindling is a gamified social app that brings people together and kindle relationships. People put collective effort into their groups as campmates to maintain and upgrade their camp, explore together, and 'keep their fire alive.'
\
\
Kindling uses several Niantic Lightship features such as the Lightship Maps for exploration and resource-gathering, which goes hand-in-hand with VPSâ€”public campgrounds where people can deploy their camps in for in-game income and show off their camps! Semantic segmentation is also in use for more interactive resource-gathering, i.e) tap on trees for wood, tap on the ground to "dig" for gold, tap on water to catch fish for food.
